 * Define the service and env based on the SARIF contents reports

 *  - if the report is produced by a third party tool, we report it as is and cannot
 *    infer the nature of the results. We still try to get the first tool from the runs.

 *  for static analysis only and one report for secrets only, they will have a different
 *  service and env for each report so that they are not discarded later in our backend.
